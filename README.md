# Code Review Week 4 Javascript
Sailor Winkelman 1/25/18

The purpose of this code review is to identify my weaknesses, and proactively address them.

## Contents

Note: This project includes content outside of github. Links are included.

1. Organize to-dos on [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/B7dYMhYH)
2. Synthesize instructor feedback from previous code reviews and identify themes.
3. Reflect on themes for life beyond Epicodus.
4. Roadmap

### Themes from Code Reviews

The feedback I received from my instructor on my code reviews for CSS and Javascript indicate the following themes in my shortcomings:

* All projects lack portoflio-quality polish and thoughtful user experience.
* I struggled to write and separate logic (but got it eventually).
* Planning and commit history is lacking until week 3 Javascript.
* I struggled to achieve all objectives on time (but got it eventually).

In addition, I can identify the following themes for myself from the experience of working on these independent projects:

* None of my projects demonstrate the level of creativity and innovation that I am capable of.
* I lack confidence in my ability to achieve the objectives throughout the process.
* I reinforce conceptual misunderstandings by doubting myself, being superstitious and getting lost.


### Themes for life beyond Epicodus

I need to continue practicing the skills I have learned so far at Epicodus, and learning every day. Through practice, I believe my confidence will improve, my ability to write logical code will improve, and I will be able to be creative as I become comfortable enough to experiment.

In addition to practicing technical skills, I need to prepare for the experience of interviewing and working in this industry. I've read several guides to technical interviews, and realize many questions I am not ready for. I need to practice these challenges specifically. In addition, I have learned that getting through to people in the industry by making connections is imperative.

Moving forward, I need to make connections in the industry, while still giving myself the time and space for dedicated practice and commitment to my work. I'm deciding that the most practical option for achieving this is to start making my practice public, and in active discourse with a community of people working on the same problems.
