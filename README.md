## Plan for 01/25/18

* Organize to-dos on [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/B7dYMhYH) x
* Synthesize instructor feedback from previous code reviews and identify themes. x
* Reflect on themes for life beyond Epicodus. x
* Create Roadmap x
* Collect current work and Resources x
-- Lunch ---
* Finish CodeNewbie Mission 1 x
* Enhance 1 Epicodus project [ not completed ]
  * Note: I didn't make much progress from 2.30-4.15 on my [Animal Inventory](https://github.com/sailor27/animal-inventory) refactor. I improved the CSS a little, but felt limited and wanted to set up a router and set up SASS. I made the router, but linking to it duplicated my content, and I wasn't ready to set up a database and Service. I converted the files to SCSS, but had build errors. Then, I uninstalled bower and installed bootstrap using npm. I eventually got everything linked and could build and serve without errors in the terminal, but my page would not load and I received a console error as described in this [open issue with Angular-CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/7245). I still intend to enhance the UI for this page, but for today it is in poor shape.
* Post on Twitter
* Read A Basecs post about Data Structures and write down what I learned
* Practice JS on FreeCodeCamp


### Themes from Code Reviews

The feedback I received from my instructor on my code reviews for CSS and Javascript indicate the following themes in my shortcomings:

* All projects lack portoflio-quality polish and thoughtful user experience.
* I struggled to write and separate logic (but got it eventually).
* Planning and commit history is lacking until week 3 Javascript.
* I struggled to achieve all objectives on time (but got it eventually).

In addition, I can identify the following themes for myself from the experience of working on these independent projects:

* None of my projects demonstrate the level of creativity and innovation that I am capable of.
* I lack confidence in my ability to achieve the objectives throughout the process.
* I reinforce conceptual misunderstandings by doubting myself, being superstitious and getting lost.


### Themes for life beyond Epicodus

I need to continue practicing the skills I have learned so far at Epicodus, and learning every day. Through practice, I believe my confidence will improve, my ability to write logical code will improve, and I will be able to be creative as I become comfortable enough to experiment.

In addition to practicing technical skills, I need to prepare for the experience of interviewing and working in this industry. I've read several guides to technical interviews, and realize many questions I am not ready for. I need to practice these challenges specifically. In addition, I have learned that getting through to people in the industry by making connections is imperative.

Moving forward, I need to make connections in the industry, while still giving myself the time and space for dedicated practice and commitment to my work. I'm deciding that the most practical option for achieving this is to start making my practice public, and in active discourse with a community of people working on the same problems.
