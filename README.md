Sailor Winkelman 1/25/18

The purpose of this code review is to identify my weaknesses, and proactively address them.

## Contents

Note: This project includes content outside of github. Links are included.

1. Organize to-dos on [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/B7dYMhYH)
2. Synthesize instructor feedback from previous code reviews and identify themes.
3.

### Themes from Code Reviews

The feedback I received from my instructor on my code reviews for CSS and Javascript indicate the following themes in my shortcomings:

* All projects lack portoflio-quality polish and thoughtful user experience.
* I struggled to write and separate logic.
* Planning and commit history is lacking until week 3 Javascript.
* I struggled to achieve all objectives on time.

In addition, I can identify the following themes for myself from the experience of working on these independent projects:

* None of my projects demonstrate the level of creativity and innovation that I am capable of.
* I lack confidence in my ability to achieve the objectives throughout the process.
* I reinforce conceptual misunderstandings by doubting myself, being superstitious and getting lost.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
